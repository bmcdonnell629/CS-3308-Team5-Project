# Scrabble for the Rabble

### Team # 5

------------

**Team Name:** Scrabble Team 5

**Team Members:** Brendan McDonnell, Nathaniel  Mutkus, Tyler Sanchez, Elizabeth Strickenburg

**Team Meetings:** Tuesdays at 5:30 p.m. MT / 7:30 p.m. EST

--------

**Vision Statement:**

Our goal is to create the most comprehensive scrabble word builder in order to teach players how to boost their gameplay and maximize their turns.

**Motivation:**

Our application will allow users to grow their vocabulary of useful Scrabble words (including unusual or archaic two-letter and three-letter words), while also aiding their gameplay through a better understanding of the points associated with each word choice. This project represents a first-step MVP (minimum viable product) that could be expanded into further gameplay aids and applications. 

For us as students, this project provides an opportunity to hone our database skills by creating and integrating a database of possible words and their point values, as well as giving us a platform for developing our front-end and HTML skills by creating a web-based user interface. This project idea appealed to all team members, allowing us to grow our skills in project management and working together as a team.  

**Risks to Project Completion:**

- This is a brand new team.  No individual team member has met any other team member prior to this project.  Consequently, we are unaware of each other's strengths and weaknesses.  We also have not become familiar with each other's communication styles and preferences.  These factors may lead to reduced efficiency in the division of project tasks and issue resolution during the earlier phases of the project.
- We are new to Agile and Scrum.  This will be the first time any team member has used these methodologies to manage a project.  Progress may be slowed while we learn to work using this style of project management.
- We are new to HTML and SQL.  Again, we may be working at a reduced efficiency while we learn to translate our ideas and user stories into working HTML code while navigating the use of SQL with our database.
- Our database will include over 100,000 words.  If we choose an inefficient algorithm to search the database for words containing a specific set of letters, the product will fail to be useful, since results may take several minutes or even hours to produce.

**Risk Mitigation Strategies:**

- This is a brand new team: We will meet weekly to discuss our progress, goals, and obstacles.  We will also keep in constant communication about unexpected issues, or when we need help, so that the team can help any member that is struggling with a particular task.
- We are new to Agile and Scrum: We have studied the basics of Agile and Scrum methodologies, and will obtain guidance from our professor, peers, and online resources when we have questions.  We will use Trello to track our project and help each team member to understand their progress and role in the project.
- We are new to HTML and SQL: We will develop HTML and SQL skills through our coursework, in addition to seeking advice from our professor and peers when needed, and consulting online resources frequently.  Again, communication within the team will also help remove barriers to progress for individual team members when unable to get any particular piece of code working.
- Our database will include over 100,000 words: We will test our code frequently to verify it meets our time criteria (TBD).  We will employ various pruning methods to limit our search space.

**Development Method:**

The development method that we will be using is the scrum method. One aspect of this is having a scrum master for all of our meetings. We will rotate through all team members based on the different sprints that we have. There will be a weekly stand up meeting between the four of us and the scrum master will lead those meetings when assigned that role. 

When it comes to the sprints, they will most likely be one or two weeks long. Each sprint will have a clear objective and a targeted outcome to complete a part of this project. At our next meeting, we will map out specifics on the sprints and deadlines for us to follow. Each sprint will build on top of the others and end with final implementation of the Scrabble help generator. 

We will rotate roles of scrum master, product manager, and scrum team members with the completion of each sprint. This will give each of us experience within the different roles to learn the whole scrum process. Our initial part of the scrum process, where we can plan and estimate out the project will be at our next standup.
